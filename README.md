# what is that

The start for something unique.

[plaggona](https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B1), is the same metaphor for Greek as avatar in game/movies, not so as Hindu meaning, but you get the point.

The project aim to setup an infrastructure to hold plaggonas activities in metaverse worlds.

look at this project soon, or not so soon.
