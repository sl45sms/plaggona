# what is that

The start for something unique.

[plaggona](https://el.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B3%CE%B3%CF%8C%CE%BD%CE%B1), is the same metaphor for Greek as avatar in game/movies, not so as Hindu meaning, but you get the point.

The project aim to setup an infrastructure to hold plaggonas activities in metaverse worlds.


# aim to do
keep track of the digital memories while your plaggona lives on metaverse worlds, learning from what plaggona says, what action do, the behavior and the acts, keep all that for you referense and later when the plaggona matures bring it alive!

# how can you do that

using advance monitoring while you use and act with your plaggona on any metaverse world.


* look at this project soon, or not so soon...
